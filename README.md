## What are the key parts on playing this type of game

1. **Game Setup:**
   - The game is played on a grid with three rows and three columns, resulting in a total of nine cells.
   - Two players participate, typically using the symbols "X" and "O."
   - The grid is initially empty.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell on the grid.
   - The first player usually starts with "X," and the second player follows with "O."
   - Turns alternate between the players until the game is won, resulting in a draw, or a player decides to concede.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - A player wins by having three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - The game ends immediately when a player achieves this goal, and that player is declared the winner.

4. **Draw (Tie):**
   - If the entire grid is filled, and no player has formed a winning line, the game is a draw.

5. **Strategy:**
   - The key to winning Tic-Tac-Toe is to create a situation where the opponent is forced to make a move that allows the player to form a winning line on their next turn.
   - Players often try to block their opponent from forming a winning line while simultaneously working towards creating their own winning opportunities.

6. **Common Variations:**
   - Tic-Tac-Toe can be played in larger grids, such as 4x4 or 5x5, which increases the complexity of the game.
   - Some variations involve additional rules, such as allowing players to undo their last move or introducing special cells with unique properties.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet engaging game that is often used as a teaching tool for basic game theory concepts. Despite its simplicity, it remains a popular and widely played game around the world.
